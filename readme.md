> **New in Sprint 4:** Java Swing GUI with month view and analytics dashboard, CSV import, and unified controller across CLI, headless, and GUI modes.
> **Full changelog â†’** [`changelog.md`](changelog.md)

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive virtual calendar application that mimics the core features of popular calendar software like Google Calendar and iCalendar. Built using Java with Maven, the application follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and SOLID design principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and extensibility.

**Sprint 4 Evolution:** Building upon previous iterations, Assignment 6 delivers an intuitive Java Swing GUI with month view, and day dialog. A unified controller now powers CLI, headless scripts, and GUI modes from a single JAR. Additional features include CSV import, and enhanced mutation-tested codebase.

## Key Features

### **Multi-Calendar Management**
- **Calendar Creation**: Create multiple calendars with unique names and IANA timezones
- **Calendar Selection**: Use `use calendar` command to set active calendar context
- **Calendar Editing**: Modify calendar properties including name and timezone
- **Timezone Migration**: Automatic timezone conversion when editing calendar properties

### **Event Management**
- **Single Events**: Create events with subject, start/end date-time, location, and description
- **Recurring Events**: Create repeating events with flexible scheduling options
- **All-Day Events**: Events with All Day duration
- **Universal Conflict Detection**: Automatic conflict detection enabled by default for all events
- **Event Copy Operations**: Copy events between calendars with automatic timezone conversion

### **Event Editing**
- **SINGLE Mode**: Modify individual event instances
- **FROM Mode**: Modify all events in a series from a specific point forward
- **ALL Mode**: Modify all events with the same subject

### **Query and Search**
- Print events for specific dates or date ranges
- Check calendar availability at specific times

### **Export and Integration**
- Export to CSV format compatible with Google Calendar
- Automatic expansion of recurring events into individual occurrences
- Seamless integration with external calendar applications

### **User Interface**
- **GUI Mode (default)**: Double-click the JAR or run `java -jar Assignment6.jar` to launch the Swing interface.
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time command input with immediate feedback (`java -jar Assignment6.jar --mode interactive`).
- **Headless Mode**: Batch processing from command files (`java -jar Assignment6.jar --mode headless commands.txt`).

## System Architecture

The application follows the MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns:

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or later installed on your system
- Command prompt or terminal
- JUnit 4 for running tests

### Running the Application

The application is now distributed as a compiled JAR file for easy execution:

#### GUI Mode (default)
```bash
java -jar Assignment6.jar
```
Launches the Swing interface.

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
java -jar Assignment6.jar --mode interactive
```

#### Headless Mode
```bash
java -jar Assignment6.jar --mode headless headless.txt
```

### Development Setup (Optional)

For development and testing purposes:

#### Method 1: Using Maven (Recommended)
1. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

2. **Run Interactive Mode:**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="view.CalendarApp" -Dexec.args="--mode interactive"
   ```

3. **Run Headless Mode:**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="view.CalendarApp" -Dexec.args="--mode headless path/to/commands.txt"
   ```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Calendar Operations
- **Calendar Context**: All operations are performed within the context of the active calendar
- **Cross-Calendar Copy**: Copy events between calendars with automatic timezone adjustment
- **Timezone Awareness**: Events maintain their logical time when copied across timezones

### Enhanced Conflict Management
- **Universal Auto-decline**: All events now check for conflicts by default
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: Improved conflict detection across calendar boundaries

### Recurring Event Patterns
- **Weekday Selection**: Choose specific days (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)
- **Count-based**: Repeat for a specified number of occurrences
- **Date-based**: Repeat until a specific end date
- **Individual Editing**: Modify single instances or entire series

### Data Persistence
- **CSV Export**: Google Calendar compatible format
- **Command History**: Track all operations for audit trails
- **Batch Processing**: Execute multiple commands from files

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs on every push and pull request to the main branch:

- **Unit Tests**: 450+ comprehensive test cases with JUnit 4
- **Code Coverage**: JaCoCo reports with 85%+ line coverage threshold
- **Mutation Testing**: PIT framework ensuring 89% mutation coverage
- **Quality Gates**: Automated coverage thresholds and build validation
- **Artifact Generation**: Automatic JAR builds and test report uploads

### CI/CD Features
- **Parallel Testing**: Fast execution with Maven dependency caching
- **Coverage Reports**: Automated JaCoCo and PIT report generation
- **Quality Enforcement**: Build fails if coverage drops below 85%
- **Artifact Storage**: 30-day retention for test reports, 90-day for JARs
- **PR Integration**: Automatic coverage comments on pull requests

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
mvn clean test                                    # Run unit tests with JaCoCo
mvn jacoco:report                                # Generate coverage report
